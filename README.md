## 🔒 Assumptions & Tradeoffs

- No backend/API — data stored locally in browser
- Simple modal for UX; no libraries like MUI used
- Focused on functionality and responsiveness over design complexity

---

## 🔧 What I'd Improve

- Add user auth + cloud storage
- Export/import CSV of task logs
- Drag & drop reordering of tasks
- Enhanced animations for transitions
